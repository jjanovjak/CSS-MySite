      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro">I am a semi-retired hippie trying to help supplement my fixed income. I have had a wide and varied career. Most of the jobs I held fell into two career fields - Education or Creative. I have been a life long learner and a life
        long educator. I worked in the music field teaching and I also performed. I also earned a masters degree in Technology. I worked in a variety of tech jobs including contract employment.</p>
